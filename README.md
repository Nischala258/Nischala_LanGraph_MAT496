Module 0

Setup of API keys aside from Tavily API key as it is not used until module 4

# Lesson 1:
Overview of what LangGraph is and how it can help us visualise and understand the flow of control of LLMs while showing how it can go from router to fully autonomous state with increasing agent's level of control over decisions.

# Lesson 2:
We get to learn what a graph is and how to invoke different states, nodes and edges. We also try out a simple graph invokation and see how decision takes place in them.

Tweak: Changed the graph nodes from happy and sad to grumpy and sleepy, while also adding my own name to it.
